# Finance reporting notes

## GST report limitations
- Exempt or zero-rated transactions are not currently separated in the GST report.
- Refunds and credit notes are not yet reflected in GST totals.
- The report aggregates invoices that are issued within the range and are not in DRAFT or VOID status.
- GST reports sum invoices that are not in VOID or DRAFT status. Exempt or zero-rated line items and credit notes/refunds are not yet handled, so manual adjustments may be required.
